# To-do App

**Developer:**

- Ahmet Ayberk YÄ±lmaz

# Do this to run the application

- On the project's directory, open terminal and run

```bash
docker compose up
```

- Also, I added the postman_collection of the API. Because of there were no register page, you need to create account from the Postman first. After that you can login to the application from the [a link](http://localhost:3000).
